            | I moved to Miami and decided I needed a career change. Maybe it was the paradise weather or the spicy cuban food that got me thinking.
            | I was born in Portland, OR and math was my favorite subject throughout my schooling. Which naturally carried me into 
            | achieving an Electrical Engineering degree, which lead to a career in industrial controls. 
            | My career was and is great. However, the move across the country got me thinking about things. I realized what I was doing was 95% work, and 5% a weird sort of fun.
            | Whereas, I discovered that coding is great fun... and accessible, and I believe fits my personality. I decided to take the plunge and learn about full stack javascript development.

            | I met my wife-to-be in Portland, and we moved to Miami together in 2019.
            | In Janurary 2020, we got married. In February, we moved to NY city with our dog and cat. And now currently in March, we are hunkering down and fighting the coronavirus
            | pandemic along with everyone else. 2020 has been a crazy year. If the year has been this unpredictable, I have no doubt that something as crazy as me finding a job in something
            | I enjoy is possible. Here's to me hoping that I continue to enjoy coding, and someday being able to do this as a living.
